STEP 1: Install Docker

Go to:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Download and install Docker Desktop for:

Windows

Mac

Linux (use Docker Engine)


After installing, open Docker Desktop.


---

STEP 2: Check if Docker Works

Open terminal / command prompt and type:

docker --version

You should see a version number like Docker version 27.x.x.


---

STEP 3: Run Your First Docker Container

Type:

docker run hello-world

If it prints
“Hello from Docker!”
→ Docker is working perfectly.


---

STEP 4: Check Your Containers

List running containers:

docker ps

List all containers:

docker ps -a


---

STEP 5: Download an Image

Example: pull the official Node.js image:

docker pull node


---

STEP 6: Create a Simple Container

Example: run Node in a container:

docker run -it node

This opens a terminal inside the container.


---

STEP 7: Create a Dockerfile (For Your App)

In your project folder, create a file called Dockerfile:

FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

This tells Docker how to build your app.


---

STEP 8: Build Your Image

In the project folder:

docker build -t myapp .

(This creates an image named myapp)


---

STEP 9: Run Your App Container

docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp

Now your app runs inside Docker and exposes port 3000.


---

STEP 10: Stop and Remove Containers

Stop all running containers:

docker stop $(docker ps -q)

Remove all containers:

docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Remove all images:

docker rmi $(docker images -q)
